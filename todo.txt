next:
leave displayentities in world command
configurable view distance for entities
refactor: all commands into their own files
different block palettes
effects when walking inside animations
config file to toggle particles "force" property, toggle with command too

add other particles
maybe make format big endian instead
add gzip compression
blockdisplay renderer without nms (?)

done:
-fix command aliases/usages (?), maybe not possible, fix: remove all aliases :(
-add display entities
-add config and save repeating animations
-if animation is 1 frame, hold it in memory?
-explore other text properties like bg and bg color
-custom text
-block and text scale
-create separate text renderer that spawns the entities at right locations so that the billboard constraint can be set properly
-add back removing of extra entities?
-add debug list (only display action bar to these players), /sh debug to toggle
-change cmd format similar to groupmanager, luckperms, decentholograms
-add tab completion
-rotate animations
-different methods of sending packets
-implement animationscale
-maybe add few frames buffer so gc doesn't cause lag
-clean entity animations when changing gmax
-each animation/frame gets its own portion of the max entities, for example, 3 animations, each gets 1/3
-make block display work with move packets, (color is only set once per entity?)

not needed:
optimization: remove Frame from AnimationParticle
per player packets
